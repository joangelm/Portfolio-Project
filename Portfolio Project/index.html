                                My name is
                                <span itemprop="givenName" class="font-weight-bold">JoAngel Medina</span>
                                and I am a current Computer Information Systems (CIS) student at
                                <span itemprop="affiliation">The University of Houston.</span> Family and friends call me
                                <span itemprop="additionalName">Joey</span> for short and I prefer it as a nickname. Academically, I am planning to
                                earn my
                                <span itemprop="seeks" class="font-weight-bold">Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems</span>
                                degree and pursue my career in the field of technology after graduation. My hobbies include hiking, traveling, and
                                playing sports like basketball and football. I also do enjoy watching anime shows (Hunter x Hunter, Demon Slayer, and
                                Jujutsu Kaisen), working out, listening to electric dance/house music, playing a variety of video games, and meeting
                                new folks. I have a passion for learning new skills and discovering new ideas in order to achieve personal growth.
                                Moreover, I think one of the most valuable ways you can enrich life is to experience new things and explore the open
                                world.

                                My passion will continue in learning the application of skills, processes, and methods of technology. During my time
                                as a student at <span itemprop="affiliation">The University of Houston</span>, I will look forward to enhancing my
                                knowledge and building experiences with the fundamentals of technology. Over time, technology has been drastically
                                increasing throughout the world. Information technology has been essential for aiding our society in a variety of ways
                                - such as communication, transportation, education, and health care. This subject provides many tools and methods to
                                encourage development, increase productivity, and share information. Therefore, technology greatly influences my
                                passion to learn new technical concepts and build new systems that can facilitate the needs of others. For instance, I
                                would like to learn more about web development, systems analysis, and general programming. Thus, my goal as a
                                university student is to continue to learn the primary elements of information technology/systems, attend technology
                                internships, and commence my career in the IT field by solving real business problems.
